# Kitty Companion (Desktop Kitty)

Meet your new mental health bestie! Kitty Companion is a virtual pet that walks around your desktop and reminds you to stay off your screens a little more. Interact with your kitty by clicking on it to pet it, or let it wander around and fall asleep on your screen.

This project was developed during the 24 hour Simmons University SharkHack 2025 with [@isieann](https://github.com/isieann) and [@cmfeltgood](https://github.com/cmfeltgood). Everyone did an amazing job learning Godot for this project and adapting to the nuances of an unfamiliar coding language.

Great job team!

## Further Improvements

This is my no means a finished product, but we're proud of what we created in 24 hours. Further development of this project may include adding new features like habit customization or intelligent screen time tracking.
